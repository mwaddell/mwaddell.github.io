#Senior Software Architect, Chicago Metropolitan Agency for Planning (CMAP), Regional Transportation Data Archive, 03/2012 â€“ 06/2020
#The Regional Transportation Data Archive is an application service that pulls transportation data (real time traffic speeds and volumes from road sensors, weather, incidents, etc.) from external sources and stores it for both future use and archival purposes. The application stores all downloaded data in their provided format, imports the data into a Git repository and then pushes data into a PostgreSQL database for future access by web services. The system is designed to run in parallel from two locations. The two locations synchronize databases daily and test for inconsistencies to ensure that each location contains a comprehensive archive of the dataset. The system has been designed to ensure cloud-based compatibility in the future. Key technologies: Python, APScheduler, RPyC, PsycoPg2, PostgreSQL, PyUnit, EpyDoc, PyLint, Coverage.py.
